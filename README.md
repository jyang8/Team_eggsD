What This Project Does:

Upon logging in, there are two searches: text and image.  Upon inputting an ingredient's name, the user is able to retrieve information, such as the nutritional facts, wikipedia articles, and recipes.

How To Use it:

In the text search, you can search up a specific ingredient.  There, you can select from a more refined list of ingredients.  On the information page, you will be greeted with the nutrition facts, wikipedia information, and brief recipes.  For the image search, the user inputs a url link to an image, which leads to a page with related key terms.  After clicking on one of these terms, the user will be able to get to the information page for that ingredient.
